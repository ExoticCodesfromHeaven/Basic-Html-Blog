CSS RESPONSIVE DESIGN

Websites are responsive before you write any CSS except for image elements that do not adapt.

Avoid fixed sizes in your code for instance instead of using height, use min-height so the container can expand when more space is needed, instead of doing width you do max-width and use margin-inline: auto; so when the page resizes it will automatically have a centralized margin.

Don't declare styles you don't need like viewport units you don't need

Use viewport units instead of fixed sizes

Instead of using fixed sizes on grids use auto-fill or auto-fit depending on the project for example: grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(min(200px, 100%), 200px, 1fr)); where the min inside minmax means checking which size is the smallest depending on the situation.
